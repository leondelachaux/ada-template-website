# Movies as a graph

The idea is to represent the set of movies as a graph, where every movie is a vertex that is connected to all others through weighted edges. Similar movies (like sequels) will have high-valued edges interconnecting them. It is expected that such a classification of movies divides them into clusters. This graph could then be used to suggest movies: "If you liked this movie, you might like \[top 5 connected vertices with highest edges\]". Building such a graph will allow us to explore how the movies are interconnected to each other and what is the best predictor to find similar movies. The movie recommendation system that we will create will give us insight into how such an algorithm work, will make us define what makes two movies similar and will emphasize the bias of this choice on the recommendation.

## Motivation

Insert graph.

We created a graph of the movies, that binds each movie with the most similar movies in our dataset.


## Results and analysis

### Attributes of the movie

### Topics from the plots
