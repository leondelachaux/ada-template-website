# Movies as a graph


## Introduction

The idea of our project is to represent the dataset of the movies from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus as a graph by connecting the movies looking at the similarities between them. We are operating with a dateset of 41783 movies. Based on this graph, we want to identify clusters and study the most interesting topics.
